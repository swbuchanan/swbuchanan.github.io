# Modeling a Random Event

The strategy when modeling a random event - say rolling a $$6$$-sided die - is to assign a probability to each of the different possibly outcomes of the event.
In the case of the die, these are the $$6$$ possible outcomes, along with their associated probabilities.

Why did we say that each outcome has a $$\frac 1 6$$ chance associated with it?  There are 3 ways of thinking about this.

1. This is how a die behaves; that is, if we roll a die a certain number of times, one sixth of those rolls will result in a $$1$$, one sixth will result in a $$2$$, and so on.
The problem with this reason is that we can't be sure that a given die has *exactly* a one sixth chance of rolling each face unless we can roll it infinitely many times and count the results.  We can't roll a die infinitely many times, but the idea of counting the results of infinitely many die rolls raises some interesting questions that will appear in the second section of this post.
2. This is how a die is *supposed* to behave.  This is the real reason.  The point of a die is that it chooses *uniformly* between a certain number of possibilities.  

Notice also that for a given physical die, the probability of each face turning up is not *exactly* one out of six, but we've set them all to be $$\frac 1 6$$ anyway.
Instead of looking at a particular die, we're now looking at a *mathematical model* of a die.

We can make up rules for how we want our models of random situations to behave, although generally the choices we make when writing the rules are informed by observations of specific random events.

One observation 

When we come up with a model for some random event, we can assign whatever probabilities we think will be the most useful, but the assignments we make are subject to the condition that their sum is $$1$$.

If we wanted to model an unfair die, one of the faces might have a higher probability of occurring than $$\frac 1 6$$, but then one or more of the other faces would have to have a correspondingly lowered probability in order for the total to remain at $$1$$.

We can extend this idea to model a die with as many sides as we like.  If we have an $$n$$-sided die, the probability of any given face showing is $$\frac 1 n$$.
Being mathematicians, we don't have to worry about the difficulties in manufacturing a die with an absurdly large number of sides or making sure that the die is actually fair.  These dice are entirely made up, and yet we can still roll them.

Not only can we roll them and study how they behave, we can be sure that properties we discover about these dice must translate to properties of dice in the real world.

We're not going to go in that direction, but instead, having come up with a way to model random events,
