# Finite Random Events

Consider a random event, like rolling a 6-sided die.  There are 6 possible **outcomes** of this event, and each outcome has an associated probability:

Exactly how we came up with these probabilities raises some interesting questions about mathematical modeling.
I hope to address some of these questions in another blog post.
For now I'll just point out that an obvious explanation (to me the most obvious explanation) for where these probabilities come from doesn't *quite* work.
It's intuitive to say that each face has a $$\frac 1 6$$ chance of turning up because if we roll a die a bunch of times, then each face will actually turn up a sixth of the time.
There are two layers of imprecision here:
1. Even a perfect die won't appear perfect upon experimentation: take a die and roll it, say, $$60,\hspace{-.08cm}000$$ times, and tally up the results.
I'll bet you don't get $$10,\hspace{-.08cm}000$$ ones.
The result of almost any experiment will tell us that our probabilities should be approximately, but not exactly, $$\frac 1 6$$.
One way to interpret the probability of $$\frac 1 6$$ is as an expression of what we think the results would be if we rolled our die infinitely many times and counted the results - clearly we've left the realm of experimentation, and some theoretical machinery is needed.  (This isn't the only way to interpret the probability, but like I said, this is a topic for a separate post.)
2. Rolling a die infinitely many times would indeed save us from the uncertainty inherent in a random event: the *exact* probabilities of our die would be revealed.  But then we run into the second layer of imprecision, which is that, unless we've found a perfect Platonic die to roll, the exact probabilities of our die will still not be what we predict, due to physical imperfections.

So pure experimentation doesn't quite get us there.  But enough about where the probabilities come from - I think we can all agree that however we got them, they're the right ones to use.

So now we have a mathematical model of a die, and we can ask some mathematical questions about rolling dice, and use our model to answer them.
What is the probability of rolling an even number?
If we roll three times, what is the probability of rolling $$1$$ at least twice?
If we roll five times, what is the probability that the sum of the first three rolls is less than the sum of the last two rolls?
If we start rolling and don't stop until we roll a $$1$$ and then a $$2$$ immediately afterwards, how many times will we have rolled on average?

I'll leave these questions as an exercise to the reader, since the point isn't the questions themselves, but the fact that we can answer them now that we have a model of our die.

What if we wanted to model a die that we *knew* was unfair?
Suppose you roll up to the casino with a die like this in your pocket:

That's 


When we're coming up with a mathematical model for a random event, there are three rules that it must satisfy.
The question of where these rules come from, and whether they describe or define, is related to the questions about mathematical modeling at the beginning, so I defer them to another post.  We'll take the rules for granted, although I will give intuitive reasons for their existence.

Rule 1: Probabilities are only positive.

This one needs little explanation.  When we say an outcome has probability $$\frac 1 n$$, we are saying that, on average, if we run our event $$n$$ times, we expect to see this event once.
Trying to apply this idea to a negative probability doesn't make sense.
(Note that this rule is actually broken sometimes, although in situations that involve a different understanding of probabilities.)

Rule 2: 

# Infinite Random Events

Now, having come up with some rules for how random events should work, we're going to immediately break them, by asking a simple question.

The positive integers, often called the **natural numbers**, are the following set up numbers:

$$\mathbb N = \{ 1, 2, 3, \dots \}.$$
