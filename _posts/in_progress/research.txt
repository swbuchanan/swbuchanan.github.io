title: My research, part 1: geometric evolution equations
usemathjax: true

An outline:

I study a particular type of solution to a particular geometric evolution equation.
A geometric evolution equation describes how a mathematical object called a manifold (this might sound complicated, but a simple line or a sphere is an example of a manifold) changing shape over time.
What makes the evolution geometric is that the particular way in which the manifold changes shape depends on the shape, i.e. the geometry, that the manifold has at any point in time.
This may sound complicated - and in general it is - but as is often the case in mathematics, there is much intuition to be gained by studying a simple case of this phenomenon, and a simple geometric evolution equation describes a type of event that everyone is familiar with on some level: the diffusion of heat through an object.

I'll begin by describing a mathematical phenomenon that is much simpler than what I eventually want to discuss, but has some of the same flavor.
