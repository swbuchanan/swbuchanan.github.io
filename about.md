I'm a PhD student studying geometric analysis at the Australian National University.  Below is an (outdated) link to my CV.
I hope to use this site to post short articles about topics that interest me.

If you aren't well-versed in the terminology and concepts of geometric analysis but you would like to know more about my research, you're in luck!
I'm currently working on a series of posts about my research intended for a general audience.
[Here is the first one.]({% post_url 2023-01-03-my-research-part-1 %})
