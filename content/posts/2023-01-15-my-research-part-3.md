This is the third part in a series of short articles I'm trying to write about my research.
[See the first one here.]({{< ref "2023-01-03-my-research-part-1" >}})

In this article, I will introduce some preliminary notions that will be necessary in describing the work that I do (and in fact they are fundamental to all research in geometry).
The two notions are these: manifolds and metric tensors.
A manifold is a mathematical structure that generalizes and makes precise the idea of *space*.
Space is a familiar idea.
The (physical) space we live in is (described by) a 3-dimensional manifold.
One way to see that it is 3-dimensional is to observe that if we are at some point in space, we can fix 3 different directions, perhaps forward, left, and up, and then any direction in which it is possible for us to move is some combination of these 3 directions.[^basis]
(Here we are counting moving backwards along one of these chosen directions as using that direction.)
If we had only chosen 4 directions, say forward and to the right, then we could not describe any upward or downward motion in terms of these directions.
So our physical space can't be 2 dimensional.
If we had chosen 4 directions, say forward, right, down, and a little bit up and to the left, then we have some redundancy.
We only need any 3 of these directions to describe any sort of motion we want in space.
(It's true that if we choose to use the 3 directions: forward, right, and a little bit up and to the left, then describing motion in, say, purely the leftward direction becomes unnecessarily complicated, but the important thing is that it can in principle be done.)
So 4 directions is too many.


## Footnotes

[^basis]: We do have to be just a little bit careful when choosing these directions.  For example, if we choose: forward, left, and backward, then we are unable to describe any upward or downward motion.
