Inspired by [this guy](pac.tom7.org/index.shtml), who also has a great [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c8i5SABqwU), I have recently decided to run the length of every street in Canberra, where I'm currently staying for school.
Soon I hope to update this page with some rules for the project and some information about how I'm gathering and processing the data.
For now, [here's my current progress](/all_routes.html).


This project has been put on hold as I am now living in Canada until February 2026.
