The Kelly Criterion is a classic solution to a classic problem.
Suppose I give you 100 dollars and an unfair coin.
The coin lands on heads 60% of the time, but I'll bet you even money that it lands on tails.
If I tell you that I'll offer you this bet 1000 times, and you can bet as much of your bankroll as you want, what is your best way of making money?
(Your bankroll is the 100 dollars that you started with together with any money that you win by betting against me.)
On each bet, you can maximize your expected profit by betting all of your bankroll.
However, this leaves open the possibility of losing all your money.
