### About me and this website

On this site I hope to post short articles about topics that interest me, along with some interactive demonstrations of mathematical concepts.
I may also upload some lecture notes if I ever get around to finishing any.

I can be reached at {{< email >}}


### My work

Currently I am learning and doing research in the field of geometric analysis.

Elsewhere on the site I have a brief technical description of what I'm working on at the moment.
I am also in the process of writing a series of short articles for a general audience describing a simple geometric flow called curve shortening flow.
[See the first one here.]({{< ref "/posts/2023-01-03-my-research-part-1.md" >}})

On this page I am also testing some stuff that may someday become an interesting project; see below.

### Discrete curve shortening flow

Try clicking below to add points to form a closed polygon (you have to click at least twice before anything shows up).
Once there are at least three points; the "normal vectors" at the vertices of the polygon are displayed.
Then you can click the button below to move one timestep forward to simulate the motion of the polygon under the discrete curve shortening flow.
This is a work in progress.
