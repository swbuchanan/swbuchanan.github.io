### About me and this website



On this site I hope to post short articles about topics that interest me, along with some interactive demonstrations of mathematical concepts.
I may also upload some lecture notes if I ever get around to finishing any.

I can be reached at steven.buchanan@anu.edu.au.

### My work

Currently I am learning and doing research in the field of geometric analysis.
In particular, I study geometric flows.
I am in the process of writing a series of short articles for a general audience describing a simple geometric flow called curve shortening flow.
