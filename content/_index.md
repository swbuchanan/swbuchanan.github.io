### About me and this website

On this site I hope to post short articles about topics that interest me, along with some interactive demonstrations of mathematical concepts.
I may also upload some lecture notes if I ever get around to finishing any.

I can be reached at {{< email >}}


### My work

Currently I am learning and doing research in the field of geometric analysis.

Elsewhere on the site I have a brief technical description of what I'm working on at the moment.
I am also in the process of writing a series of short articles for a general audience describing a simple geometric flow called curve shortening flow.
[See the first one here.]({{< ref "/posts/2023-01-03-my-research-part-1.md" >}})

Probably the most interesting things on this site you can find at the cool things link above.
Currently there is a visualization of discrete curve shortening flow, inspired by Anthony Carapetis, see https://a.carapetis.com/csf/.
