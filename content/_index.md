## About me and this website

On this site I hope to post short articles about topics that interest me, along with some interactive demonstrations of mathematical concepts.
I may also upload some lecture notes if I ever get around to finishing any.

I can be reached at {{< email >}}
I'm always open to questions or feedback about anything I've made. If you find anything wrong or anything that seems broken on the website, you'd be doing me a favor to let me know.

## My work

Right now I'm studying under Mat Langford at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute.
I do Ricci flow.
Elsewhere on the site I have a brief technical description of what I'm working on at the moment.
I am also in the process of writing a series of short articles for a general audience describing a simple geometric flow called curve shortening flow.
[See the first one here.]({{< ref "/posts/2023-01-03-my-research-part-1.md" >}})

I also have some interactive visualizations of geometric flows on this website, under one of the links above.
Inspired by Anthony Carapetis, see https://a.carapetis.com/csf/ for a nice visualization of the curve shortening flow.

## Notes

I'm writing some notes on calculations in Riemannian geometry, since I hate calculations.
