## About me

On this site I hope to post short articles about topics that interest me, along with some interactive demonstrations of mathematical concepts.

I can be reached at {{< email >}}
I'm always open to questions or feedback about anything I've made. If you find anything wrong or anything that seems broken on the website, you'd be doing me a favor to let me know.

## My work

Right now I'm studying geometric flows under Mat Langford at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute.
I'm working on Ricci flow and a related conformal flow.
Elsewhere on the site I have a brief technical description of some of what I'm working on at the moment.

If you are curious about geometric flows, I have started a series of posts introducing this topic to a general audience.
[See the first one here.]({{< ref "/posts/2023-01-03-my-research-part-1.md" >}})

For an interactive demonstration of a geometric flow with some applications in materials science, see [Anthony Carapetis's page](https://a.carapetis.com/csf/) for a nice visualization of the curve shortening flow.

My earliest post also has a couple of similar things to play with.

## Notes

I'm writing some notes on calculations in Riemannian geometry.
They're still in progress, but there's enough done that I often find them useful, so maybe other people will too.
